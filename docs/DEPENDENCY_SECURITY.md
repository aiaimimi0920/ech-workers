# Dependency and source security

This repository adapts the verified configuration from
[aiaimimi0920/Loom at 34f541c](https://github.com/aiaimimi0920/Loom/tree/34f541c4b6c60a868637f531db3b5dd04e5e4b66).
The bounded CodeQL summary and synthetic tests derive from that exact source.

Dependabot checks root gomod dependencies and GitHub Actions weekly, with at most
three gomod and two Actions version PRs. Minor/patch gomod updates are grouped;
major versions stay individual. Cooldowns are 21/7/3 days for gomod
major/minor/patch and seven days for Actions. No workflow approves, merges,
dismisses, or ignores alerts.

Dependency Security runs on PRs, main pushes, weekly, and manual dispatch.
It executes OSV scanner and reporter 2.5.1 directly from the immutable image
`ghcr.io/google/osv-scanner-action@sha256:dcd947131d8d11b8d0964de6590661fb921a4ecbd7b90a7cb21083acfc3fd8cc`.
The scanner explicitly reads committed root `go.mod`, after validating
`go.mod` and `go.sum`. `--no-call-analysis=go` leaves Go builds to CodeQL.
OSV 2.5.1's Go extractor counts both the declared module and a stdlib inferred
from go.mod's minimum Go version. Its default filter then removes that inferred
stdlib before advisory matching. The previous wrapper log count (2 extracted)
and current JSON count (1 inventoried gorilla/websocket 1.5.3) have different
semantics, not new deduplication. CI reports both counts and exact module IDs.
This does not establish advisory coverage of the actual build toolchain. See
[the pinned filter](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner/blob/v2.5.1/pkg/osvscanner/osvscanner.go)
and [the pinned extractor](https://github.com/google/osv-scalibr/blob/23fa66ca68dd/extractor/filesystem/language/golang/gomod/gomod.go).
Containers run only in hosted Linux CI with no credentials, a read-only project
mount and filesystem, dropped capabilities, and bounded time/resources.

The repository runner preserves scanner exits: 0 is healthy, 1 is vulnerabilities,
and other statuses fail execution. Before calling the reporter it requires
bounded valid JSON, nonempty package inventory from the exact lock input, and
agreement between vulnerability inventory and exit status. The reporter must
return the matching 0/1 status and valid SARIF with the expected finding count.
Only verified reports can upload; a vulnerability still fails the scan step
while its SARIF uploads. The category preserves the previous OSV analysis key.
There are zero exceptions and no ignore-unfixed filter.

The upstream reporter can return 0 and empty SARIF for missing/bad JSON.
Hosted CI runs actual pinned binaries against offline synthetic fixtures to
reproduce and reject those cases, abnormal scanner/reporter exits, zero inputs,
and empty inventory, alongside healthy and known-vulnerability cases.
The advisory fixture is GO-2021-0053 from OSV-Scanner's v2.5.1 test data; it is
not a production exception. These binary tests are skipped outside hosted Linux.
The shared npm validator uses the existing npm's bundled Arborist to load the
virtual lock graph offline, without installs or lifecycle scripts. It follows all
applicable mandatory, peer, alias and linked resolutions, rejects missing or
incompatible transitive entries and missing link targets, and uses npm's platform
rules. Missing optional/optional-peer edges are allowed. Inapplicable optional
OS/CPU/libc subtrees are skipped, while applicable optional packages must still
have complete mandatory dependencies. This platform-specific graph check does
not remove any packages or vulnerabilities from OSV's full lock scan.

CodeQL scans Go, JavaScript/TypeScript and GitHub Actions with security-extended
queries and full-branch analysis. Go runs tests and builds manually; JavaScript
and Actions use no-build extraction. Language categories remain
`/language:${{ matrix.language }}`. All actions have immutable SHA pins.
Checkout disables persisted credentials. Permissions are contents:read, plus
actions:read and security-events:write for upload jobs.

The summary separates finding metadata from diagnostic errors and failed
invocations. After analysis uploads the complete SARIF, the repository enforces a finding
gate: security severity >=7 or standard SARIF error level exits 1. Diagnostic or
inventory failures exit 2 and stay distinct. All findings and counts remain
visible; the gate counts even findings beyond the bounded summary output cap. Missing/invalid SARIF or upload errors
fail their job. Summary counts are SARIF results, not deduplicated native alerts;
source snippets, messages, and flows are omitted.

Local checks:

```sh
python3 scripts/check_security_inputs.py gomod
node --test scripts/tests/codeql-summary.test.mjs scripts/tests/security-inputs.test.mjs
```

On Windows set `PYTHON` to an available Python 3 executable for the Node tests.
Real binary tests run through the pure dependency workflow, without production
maintenance, deployment, publishing, signing, or secrets.

Repository files establish CI entrypoints, not native security settings.
Dependabot alerts, dependency graph, automatic security updates, secret scanning,
and protection settings were not changed. Native status has not been independently verified by this task. The local
severity/error gate does not depend on reading native thresholds; enabling native
switches alone does not prove equivalent protection. SARIF uploads succeeded in
real CI, but upload-failure fault injection has not been executed.
